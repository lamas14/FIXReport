FIXReport
=========

 After six hours of research, this is what I have created to parse Financial Information eXchange(FIX 4.4) 
 NewOrderSingle messages. Most of the information I used was from http://www.fixprotocol.org. 
 
 In this project, I have only checked for mandatory fields in the message. More tags information can be found
 here, http://btobits.com/fixopaedia/fixdic44/fields_by_tag_.html.
